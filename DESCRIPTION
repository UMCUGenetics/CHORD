Description: CHORD is a random forest model that uses the relative counts of somatic mutation contexts to predict
	homologous recombination deficiency (HRD). The primary contexts used by CHORD are deletions with
	flanking microhomology and 1-100kb structural duplications. Additionally, 1-100kb structural
	duplications are used to distinguish BRCA1-type HRD from BRCA2-type HRD.
